     * Observation:
     * 1) You can execute  more loops

     * 3) I Use VM GraalVM CE 17.0.8+7.1 - Without volatile --- With no Errors
     *          VM GraalVM CE 17.0.9+9.1 - With    volatile --- With no Errors

     *    I Use VM Corretto-19.0.2.7.1   - Without volatile --- With Errors

     *
     *    I donÂ´t know all details, but it's verry important: There are diferences between JVMs and if your application is
     *    MultThread, you must test your application with more them one JVMs.
